7. Click on the distribution tab and then the pencil icon![](https://blog.speechkit.io/content/images/downloaded_images/Setup--RSS/1-eUoT306hrxRG1G0KJhSe9g.png)

8. Copy the audio player HTML iFrame and insert it into your HTML news story templates \(don’t worry the player won’t appear unless audio exists for that story\).![](https://blog.speechkit.io/content/images/downloaded_images/Setup--RSS/1-SEw0wpgBmgM61ZxJ07ri4Q.png)

9. Each time that a story is published to your RSS feed it will be converted to audio and your readers will be able to listen to it using the audio player.![](https://blog.speechkit.io/content/images/downloaded_images/Setup--RSS/1-VmuB4X9ZvNd70CeQYbufqg.gif)
