# SpeechKit on AMP

## Adding embed code to your AMP template

To enable the SpeechKit player on AMP, you must add our AMP-specific embed-code to your your template file.

Copy the snippet below into your AMP template, replacing **\[project-id\]** with your own **Project ID**.

{% code title="HTML Snippet:" %}
```bash
<amp-iframe id="speechkit-io-iframe" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" 
src="https://app.speechkit.io/api/v2/projects/[project-id]/podcasts/iframe.html" 
layout="fixed-height" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="43px" width="auto" >
<amp-img width="643" height="150" layout="responsive" 
src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/speechkit-js/logo.svg" placeholder></amp-img></amp-iframe>
```
{% endcode %}

There may be cases where the audio hasn't yet been ingested and in these instances, there will be an empty space where the player has failed to load.

It is worth noting that the player will not render when audio is unavailable, though due to AMP restrictions we cannot hide an amp-iframe \(as we do normally\). To solve this you will need to add a javascript function to show/hide the amp-frame and this must be added on your side due to the restrictions.

The function needs to make a request to the SpeechKit API and perform a check for the audio. The iframe can then be shown/hidden, depending on the response. 

The following snippet of code will generate the request URL needed, simply substitute **\[project-id\]** for your **Project ID**:

```bash
const sAPIBaseUrl = 'https://app.speechkit.io/api/v2/projects/';
const sProjectID = '[project-id]';
const sPageUrl = window.location.href.split(/[?#]/)[0];
const sRequestUrl = sAPIBaseUrl + sProjectID + '/podcasts/search?url=' + encodeURIComponent(sPageUrl);
```

When you make a request to the _sRequestUrl_, it will return a _200 JSON_ response for an existing audio article, or a _404 Not Found_ response for an article that can't be found. You can then show/hide the iframe according to this response.
